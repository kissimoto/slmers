            <h2>What is an SLM?</h2>
            <p>Small Language Models (SLMs) sit at the opposite end of the spectrum from Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
            <p>LLMs are designed to extract knowledge from vast datasets, often without the explicit knowledge or consent of the users whose data they ingest.</p>
            <p>LLMs require vast investments in infrastructure to power these propositions.</p>
            <p>SLMs are the exact opposite, they are green, efficient and in the case of KiWacht incorporate human input through user defined rules.</p>

                        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) require massive data centres often located outside the EU, creating legal and ethical risks under GDPR. SLMs enable digital sovereignty by operating within European legal frameworks, ensuring compliance with strict data protection laws while maintaining high performance for specific tasks.</p>
                        <p>This approach breaks dependency on US and Chinese cloud AI infrastructure, giving European organisations full control over their AI systems and data.</p>

                        <p>GDPR compliance isn't an afterthought—it's engineered into the core architecture of our SLM solutions. From data minimisation principles to purpose limitation, every aspect is designed with privacy as the default setting.</p>
                        <p>Unlike bolted-on compliance measures, our approach ensures that privacy protections are inherent to the system's operation, providing robust defense against data breaches and unauthorised access.</p>

                        <p>Your sensitive business data remains yours alone. Our SLMs do not use customer data for training or model improvement. This fundamental principle builds trust by ensuring that proprietary information never leaves your controlled environment.</p>
